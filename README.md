# NotLoader
Repository for small game "NotLoader". 

 ### The Project
 Basically, this is just a small project I made in a few days because I was inspired by hook based movement in games.
 So I just went ahead and made my own little game.
 
 Some of the gameplay is similar to Floating Point, as it was a close parallel and helped give me direction on the gameplay.
 If you have any issues, feel free to say so.
 The game was/is only a small project, so I might not fix or update this all that often.
